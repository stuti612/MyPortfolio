                Essentially, it is used by programmers to develop web-based applications. MEAN is also used to develop hybrid mobile applications, as opposed to native apps that are developed through other stacks. This open-source stack technology is JavaScript-based and offers a wide range of useful plugins and tools that are helpful for MEAN stack developers to create mobile and web applications very quickly. <br>

                MEAN stack developers have the advantage of working with an abundance of compatible tools and useful plugins that optimize time for system administration purposes. It is a powerful stack that also enables developers to deploy applications rapidly and aids them in solving complex development challenges. It is one of the most popular and among the fastest-growing open-source development frameworks with wide applicability and demand. <br>

                If you wish to enhance your skills in full-stack development, MEAN stack is one way to go. MEAN stack developers are now being hired by software companies because they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to build a website or mobile apps from scratch quickly, ensuring that the apps are developed in a short duration and are lightweight. MEAN Stack Development is ideal for tech enthusiasts trying to build their careers in the startup sector and its unique and flexible offerings ensure a high salary of up to INR 4 LPA, according to GUVI Hiring Team.
