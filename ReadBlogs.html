            <p class="paragraph1">React  was originally created by a software engineer at Facebook, and was later open-sourced. It is maintained by Facebook, as well as a community of development companies and individual developers. <br>
            The React library can be used for creating views rendered in HTML. React views are declarative. This means that developers don’t have to worry about managing the effects of changes in the view’s state (the object that determines how components behave) or changes in the data. <br>
                
            Instead of relying on templates to automate the creation of repetitive HTML or DOM (Document Object Model) elements, React uses a full-featured programming language (JavaScript) to construct repetitive or conditional DOM elements. <br>
                
            With React, the same code can run on both the server and the browser. <br>
                
            React anchors the MERN stack. In a way, it’s the defining feature of the stack. It’s the one component that differentiates MERN from MEAN, another popular JavaScript stack that uses AngularJS (a front-end web application framework) instead of the React library.</p>

                Essentially, it is used by programmers to develop web-based applications. MEAN is also used to develop hybrid mobile applications, as opposed to native apps that are developed through other stacks. This open-source stack technology is JavaScript-based and offers a wide range of useful plugins and tools that are helpful for MEAN stack developers to create mobile and web applications very quickly. <br>

                MEAN stack developers have the advantage of working with an abundance of compatible tools and useful plugins that optimize time for system administration purposes. It is a powerful stack that also enables developers to deploy applications rapidly and aids them in solving complex development challenges. It is one of the most popular and among the fastest-growing open-source development frameworks with wide applicability and demand. <br>

                If you wish to enhance your skills in full-stack development, MEAN stack is one way to go. MEAN stack developers are now being hired by software companies because they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to build a website or mobile apps from scratch quickly, ensuring that the apps are developed in a short duration and are lightweight. MEAN Stack Development is ideal for tech enthusiasts trying to build their careers in the startup sector and its unique and flexible offerings ensure a high salary of up to INR 4 LPA, according to GUVI Hiring Team.
